Python project demonstrating the entropy of language via the Shannon game

## What is the Shannon game?
In the mid-1900s, Claude Shannon founded and expanded electronic communications
based on his famous information theory masters thesis.

The Shannon game is aimed at revealing the entropy of language, particularly a
single letter. In this game, the player is presented with a series of blanks
that represent letters or spaces. The player must guess the letters of the
phrase or word in successive order, with their number of guesses being recorded.
